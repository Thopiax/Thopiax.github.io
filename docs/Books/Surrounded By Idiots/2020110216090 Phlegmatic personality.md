# 2020110216090 Phlegmatic personality


A *phlegmatic* person, referred to as Green in *Surrounded by Idiots*[^1], is **calm**, **non-confrontational** and a **good listener**. Their **loyalty** is hard to earn, but unwavering and eternal once you’ve bonded. They are **resistant to change**, which means their **routines are sacred** to them. Their [[🐮 Stoicism|stoic]] nature makes them **ideal team players**.

## Appearance

Their resistance to change makes them inherently **stubborn** and **inflexible** people. They can be seen as **indifferent** or unconcerned with others problems due to their nonchalant attitude.

## Feedback

Someone from with these personality traits can have a **fragile ego** with a strong capacity for self-criticism. For this reason, harsh feedback will only make the negative self-talk worse. Instead, make it clear that the feedback is **nothing personal**, just some friendly advice for slight adjustments. Rather than giving drastic solutions to amorphous problems, **provide clear and gradual instructions** to eventually arrive at the solution.

## Stressors

The phlegmatic personality can easily get stressed if you **take away their sense of security** - through drastic changes that disrupt their routines, leaving their work unfinished or making them work on something that is already finished. They value **privacy**.
