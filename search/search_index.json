Although we can't squeeze the enormous complexity of people into these four boxes, they are good indications of people's tendencies (especially in a professional environment). You can view the personalities in a 2x2 matrix: Introverted Extroverted Tasks & Issues Melancholic Choleric People & Relationships Phlegmatic Sanguine The former pair of classes (i.e. choleric and melancholic ) share a focus on tasks and issues , so a more abstract perspective of the world.

When inspiring sanguines and stable phlegmatic personalities collaborate, everyone involved will be happy, although it may take a while longer to complete the project since neither are task oriented. Matching personalities vertically (i.e. sanguine with choleric , melancholic with phlegmatic ) also provides chances for complementary partnerships, albeit less effective. On the left hand side, the introverted melancholics and phlegmatics will reach diligent conclusions, but may have trouble taking decisive action. On the right hand side, the extraverted cholerics and sanguines will produce a lot of dialogue, but nobody from either side may be listening. It is in diagonal groupings where shit really hits the fan. The phlegmatic will find choleric people overly confrontational and aggressive, and the choleric will find phlegmatic whiny. Worst of all, melancholic people tend to be exasperated by sanguine \u2019s distracted and unprepared personality whereas the sanguine people will be bored by the melancholic 's robotic tendencies.
