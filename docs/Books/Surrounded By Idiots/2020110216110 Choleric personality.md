# 2020110216110 Choleric personality


The *choleric* personality is characterized by their **competitiveness**, **ambition** and a (often) **short fuse**. They are not afraid to challenge the status quo.[^1]

## Appearance

This combination of attributes means that they may be perceived as rude and aggressive by others, while not understanding that their actions can be overbearing and annoying.

## Feedback

They detest pointless chitchat, so it is important to give them feedback that is **straight-to-the-point** with concrete examples. Remember to **stay strong** when they bite back, since any backpedaling may lead them to think there is no problem at all.

## Stressors

They are stressed by an **overall lack of stimulation**, from doing nothing to not being able to exercise authority over someone.
