# 2020110216110 Melancholic personality 


The *melancholic* people are **conscientious**, **perfectionists** and **pessimists**, although they would argue they are realists.[^1]

Their focus on tasks and issues people also makes them extremely detail-oriented which can lead to **unhealthy perfectionism**. **Silence is a virtue** for the melancholic person, so when they do decide to speak, you can be sure their words will be profound.

## Appearance

Their preference for silence may be perceived as **aloofness** and their **excruciating attention to detail** can seem exaggerated and overbearing.

## Feedback

Your feedback to someone in this category must be **data-oriented**, factual and **detailed with a fine-tooth comb**. You can skip the niceties and the small talk, it is as if you were speaking to a robot.

## Stressors

You can make them stressed by forcing them to be **spontaneous risk-takers** or to **make changes without telling them why**. Like [[2020110216090 Phlegmatic personality|phlegmatic people]], they value **privacy.**
