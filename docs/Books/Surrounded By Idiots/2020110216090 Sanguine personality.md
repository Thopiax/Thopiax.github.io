# 2020110216090 Sanguine personality

A person with a *sanguine* personality are Yellow like the sun: **cheerful**, **talkative** and **confident**.[^1] Their contagious positivity makes them charming to some, and annoying to others.

## Appearance

They may be perceived to be **egotistical**, **careless** and **easily distracted**, which may hurt their feelings since they value people and relationships. However, due to their positive nature, they **don’t tend to hold a grudge**.

## Feedback

**Be open, amiable** and **good natured** when interacting with them to make them feel at ease. When providing feedback, prepare an **agenda with a detailed list of main points** to get back on track when the conversation gets derailed and ensure your message is received despite their disorganization.

## Stressors

Sanguine people get stressed when they are **ignored, isolated** or **surrounded by pessimists**. They are also very sensitive to public reprisal, or “humiliation” as they probably see it.
