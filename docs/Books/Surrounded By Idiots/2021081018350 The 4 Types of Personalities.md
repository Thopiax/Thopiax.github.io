# 2021081018350 The 4 Types of Personalities

Dating all the way back to Ancient Greece, Hippocrates' theory of personality classifies people into 4 personality types.[^1] There is the [[2020110216110 Choleric personality |choleric]], [[2020110216110 Melancholic personality |melancholic]], [[2020110216090 Sanguine personality |sanguine]] and [[2020110216090 Phlegmatic personality |phlegmatic]] personalities. Although we can't squeeze the enormous complexity of people into these four boxes, they are good indications of people's tendencies (especially in a professional environment).

You can view the personalities in a 2x2 matrix:

|                            | Introverted | Extroverted |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Tasks & Issues**         | Melancholic | Choleric    |
| **People & Relationships** | Phlegmatic  | Sanguine             |

The former pair of classes (i.e. [[2020110216110 Choleric personality|choleric]] and [[2020110216110 Melancholic personality|melancholic]]) share a focus on¬†**tasks and issues**, so a more abstract perspective of the world. When dominant [[2020110216110 Choleric personality|choleric]] and conscientious [[2020110216110 Melancholic personality|melancholic]] people work together, ‚Äúit‚Äôs like giving a project a gas pedal and a break, respectively.‚Äù

Conversely, the people in the latter classes (i.e. [[2020110216090 Sanguine personality|sanguine]] and [[2020110216090 Phlegmatic personality|phlegmatic]]) tend to focus on¬†**people and relationships.**¬†When inspiring sanguines and stable [[2020110216090 Phlegmatic personality|phlegmatic]] personalities collaborate, everyone involved will be happy, although it may take a while longer to complete the project since neither are task oriented.

Matching personalities vertically (i.e. [[2020110216090 Sanguine personality|sanguine]] with [[2020110216110 Choleric personality|choleric]], [[2020110216110 Melancholic personality|melancholic]] with [[2020110216090 Phlegmatic personality|phlegmatic]]) also provides chances for complementary partnerships, albeit less effective. On the left hand side, the introverted melancholics and phlegmatics will reach diligent conclusions, but may have trouble taking decisive action. On the right hand side, the extraverted cholerics and sanguines will produce a lot of dialogue, but nobody from either side may be listening.

It is in diagonal groupings where shit really hits the fan. The [[2020110216090 Phlegmatic personality|phlegmatic]] will find [[2020110216110 Choleric personality|choleric]] people overly confrontational and aggressive, and the [[2020110216110 Choleric personality|choleric]] will find [[2020110216090 Phlegmatic personality|phlegmatic]] whiny. Worst of all, [[2020110216110 Melancholic personality|melancholic]] people tend to be exasperated by [[2020110216090 Sanguine personality|sanguine]]‚Äôs distracted and unprepared personality whereas the [[2020110216090 Sanguine personality|sanguine]] people will be bored by the [[2020110216110 Melancholic personality|melancholic]]'s robotic tendencies. This can be dissuaded by throwing a couple of diplomatic [[2020110216090 Phlegmatic personality|phlegmatic]] onto the mix.
